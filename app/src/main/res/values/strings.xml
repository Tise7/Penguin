    <string name="penguin_1_name">Emperor Penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri)</string>
    <string name="penguin_1_description">The Emperor Penguin is the largest of all penguin species, reaching up to 48 inches (122 cm) in height and weighing between 50 to 100 pounds (22–45 kg). Native to Antarctica, they are adapted to extreme cold, with their thick layers of blubber and feathers that provide insulation against freezing temperatures.</string>
    <string name="penguin_1_lifestyle_and_hab1itat">Emperor Penguins are primarily found on the Antarctic ice and in the surrounding cold waters. They are exceptional divers, reaching depths of over 1,800 feet (550 meters) and holding their breath for more than 20 minutes. Their lifestyle revolves around the harsh Antarctic climate, where they spend much of their life at sea, returning to the ice only to breed.</string>
    <string name="penguin_1_relationships">These penguins form large, tightly-knit colonies that provide protection against predators and extreme weather. They are known for their deep bonds, especially between mating pairs and their chicks. Males are particularly dedicated, incubating the single egg on their feet under a brood pouch for about two months without eating.</string>
    <string name="penguin_1_history_and_lifespan">Emperor Penguins have fascinated explorers and scientists since their discovery. They can live up to 20 years in the wild, although many do not survive past infancy due to the harsh environment and predation.</string>
    <string name="penguin_1_diet" >Their diet mainly consists of fish, squid, and krill. They are skilled hunters, using their streamlined bodies to catch prey during deep dives.</string>
    <string name="penguin_1_Breeding">Breeding occurs during the harsh Antarctic winter. After laying a single egg, the female transfers it to the male and heads to the sea to feed. The male then endures the brutal winter, fasting and incubating the egg until it hatches. The chick is dependent on its parents for warmth and food until it can fend for itself.</string>
    <string name="penguin_1_size_and_weight">Emperor Penguins are the largest penguin species, standing nearly 4 feet tall and weighing up to 100 pounds</string>
    <string name="threats_to_penguin_1">Climate change poses the most significant threat to Emperor Penguins, as melting ice reduces their breeding grounds and affects their food supply. Overfishing and ocean pollution also threaten their survival.</string>

    <string name="penguin_2_name">King Penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus) </string>
    <string name="penguin_2_description">The King Penguin is the second–largest penguin species, reaching about 35 inches (90 cm) in height and weighing between 24 to 35 pounds (11–16 kg). Known for their striking appearance, King Penguins have vibrant orange patches on their heads and chests, contrasting sharply with their sleek black and white bodies. </string>
    <string name="penguin_2_lifestyle_and_hab1itat">King Penguins inhabit sub-Antarctic islands and cold, northern regions of Antarctica. They are known for their long-distance foraging trips, often covering hundreds of miles in search of food. Unlike the Emperor Penguin, King Penguins do not face the extreme cold of the Antarctic winter, but they are still well-adapted to their chilly environment. </string>
    <string name="penguin_2_relationships">These penguins form large colonies, sometimes numbering in the hundreds of thousands. They are social birds, engaging in complex vocalizations and displays to communicate with one another. King Penguins are monogamous during the breeding season, with pairs often staying together for multiple years. </string>
    <string name="penguin_2_history_and_lifespan">King Penguins have been studied extensively, with their unique breeding cycle attracting significant interest. They can live up to 25 years in the wild, although many succumb to predators or food scarcity. </string>
    <string name="penguin_2_diet" >Their diet primarily consists of small fish, particularly lanternfish, as well as squid and krill. They are proficient hunters, diving to depths of over 1,000 feet (300 meters) and remaining underwater for several minutes. </string>
    <string name="penguin_2_Breeding">King Penguins have a prolonged breeding cycle, lasting about 14 to 16 months. They lay a single egg, which both parents take turns incubating. The chick takes about 10 to 13 months to fledge, meaning that King Penguins only breed twice every three years. </string>
    <string name="penguin_2_size_and_weight">These penguins are sizable, standing about 3 feet tall and weighing around 30 pounds. </string>

    <string name="penguin_3_name">Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) </string>
    <string name="penguin_3_description">The Adelie Penguin is a small but robust species, standing about 28 inches (70 cm) tall and weighing between 8 to 12 pounds (3.6–5.5 kg). They are easily recognizable by their classic black and white plumage and distinctive white ring around their eyes. </string>
    <string name="penguin_3_lifestyle_and_habitat">Adelie Penguins are true Antarctic inhabitants, living on the continent\'s ice and surrounding islands. They are highly social birds, often found in large colonies. These penguins are strong swimmers, capable of covering vast distances in search of food. </string>
    <string name="penguin_3_relationships">Adelie Penguins form monogamous pairs during the breeding season, with both parents sharing the responsibilities of incubating eggs and feeding chicks. They communicate using a variety of calls and visual displays, maintaining close relationships within their colonies. </string>
    <string name="penguin_3_history_and_lifespan">Adelie Penguins have a rich history, with explorers like James Clark Ross first documenting them in the 19th century. They can live up to 20 years, though many face threats from predation and harsh environmental conditions. </string>
    <string name="penguin_3_diet" >Their diet mainly consists of krill, but they also eat fish and squid. Adelie Penguins are agile hunters, often seen porpoising through the water as they chase their prey. </string>
    <string name="penguin_3_Breeding">Breeding occurs during the Antarctic summer, with Adelie Penguins returning to the same breeding grounds year after year.
